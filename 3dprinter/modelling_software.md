# 3D Modeling Software

Custom models for 3D printing can be created with 3D modeling/CAD software. For beginners we recommend using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) which is free and can be used from a web browser. If you have prior experience in 3D modeling/CAD, [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) can be used as a professional alternative. Fusion 360 is also free for Students.  
You can of course you any other tool as well, as long as it supports exporting models as `.STL` files.

## Getting started with TinkerCAD

1. To start using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) you have to create account via the "Join Now" button and the "Create a personal account" option.

2. After account creation you should be offered a basic tutorial. Alternatively you can access it [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/join?next=%2Fthings%2Fnewv2%3Fcollectionid%3DOPC41AJJKIKDWDV%26lessonid%3DE6AF3CLJJOJZI5K%26projectid%3DOPC41AJJKIKDWDV%26title%3DPlace%2BIt%2521).

3. After creating your model you can export it as an `.STL` file:

4. Now you can use the `.STL` to prepare your print using CURA (see [Slicing](slicing)).
