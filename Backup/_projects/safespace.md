### Safe Space

Safe Space is a virtual zone surrounding every traffic participant, granting them the physical space on the street they need to feel and be safe.
The increasing amount of traffic in cities and the growing variety of mobility types, forces drivers to be more attentive than they previously were. As a result, lack of communication and misunderstandings are causing a lot of trouble on the roads.

Safe Space is a system in which both vulnerable users (such as bikes and e-scooters) and heavy traffic participants
(such as buses) can equip themselves with a device out of the Safe Space product family. Through sensors and connectivity, road users can communicate with one another through contextual warnings. And share information in real time.
Safe Space makes others more aware of oneâ€™s presence when someone is about to enter their safe space.
It takes care of dangers for every single traffic participant and takes away a lot of traffic related stress.
In this way, it reduces the uncertainties, stress and misunderstandings that occur when travelling in the city by having a safer road.
The gathered data can also be provided to governments and municipalities to optimize their infrastructure from which everyone can benefit.
