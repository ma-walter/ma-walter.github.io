### **Memory Wall of Tartu** 

In 2024 Tartu will become one of the European Capitals of Culture. The challenge-giver for the project, the team of organizers of the [Tartu-2024](https://www.tartu2024.ee/) event, saw this as a great opportunity to find a way to mobilize the community of Southern Estonians all over the world and that is why posed the question "How might we engage former Southern Estonians to contribute to European Capital of Culture Tartu 2024?".
The team's main task was to create a solution that would allow people who were born and raised in
Southern Estonia and now live elsewhere in the world to take part and contribute to the
event. Our final proposed solution to this challenge is called the “Memory Wall of Tartu”. It
is an online interactive map to which users can add their memories connected to
Southern Estonia. The “Memory Wall” has a social aspect that would allow for a maximum
engagement of the community. Users can react and add comments to the memories as well
as share their memories online in social media. In order to bring the “Wall” to life we
suggest turning it into a series of digital projections in Tartu during the event.
