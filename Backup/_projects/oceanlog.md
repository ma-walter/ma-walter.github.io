### OCEANLOG â€“ The new wave of logitsics

Oceanlog is a tracking based software solution for offshore drilling platforms to simplify and improve their logistics process. The application was developed in direct cooperation with its users to make it humancentric and easy to implement. Currently, the whole workflow of Maersk Drilling and its corporations is heavily paper-based and involves a lot of unnecessary communication. Additionally, the management of deck space on a drilling platform is hardly documented in any way, so the location of containers is lost after a couple of days. 
This is when Oceanlog comes into play. The software tracks all containers and their content by GPS beacons that are attached to containers.  The Oceanlog software processes this information and makes it available to all users via a virtual map. Furthermore, all paper-based processes can be handled easily through the developed web application. To share information among all parties a dashboard depicts all critical information at once.
