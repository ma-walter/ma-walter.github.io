### We help to transport your kids safely
The small city of Tartu, a cultural and intellectual center of Estonia, thrives to become a smart city. Many environmentally friendly solutions have been already implemented by the city to achieve this goal but one of the global problems - excessive usage of private vehicles - still remains. This is especially true for people living in the vicinity of Tartu who travel not only within their region but also into the city center for work, transporting children to school, sports, and other activities. Leeroy - a school bus system - provides flexible buses that transport these kids safely. The system can be booked via a smartphone app where you can register your child and indicate all the movements that would require transportation. Smart routes are created based on demand. This does not only save the parents' time and traffic stress but also helps to reduce CO2 emissions.
