### **AfB** 

More and more people possess smartphones nowadays. However, when a person switches between devices, the older used phone is often still in good condition and could be reused. The challenge-giver [AfB](https://www.afb-group.de/en/home/) aims to tackle this problem. They are a non-profit company that focuses on refurbishing used electronic devices like laptops, phones, and more, which they receive from their partner organizations. They stand for being environmentally friendly and contributing to the common welfare as they employ many disabled people. They provided the student team with the following challenge: „How might we motivate and enable people to provide or sell their smartphones to AfB?“. To solve the problem, the team came up with a design for a process that allows people to sell their no-longer-used smartphones to AfB to be refurbished and reused. An easy visualization on the AfB website enables users to see at first glance what the process is all about. The user can immediately start the process of evaluating their smartphone and selling it to AfB. The process is convenient to go through and reduces the necessary communication and time invested to a minimum amount. The user is left off with the sure feeling to have contributed to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future through the communication and process concept created by the student team.
