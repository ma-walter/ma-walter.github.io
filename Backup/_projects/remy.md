### ReMY

The overfishing of our seas is more and
more becoming an essential problem of
our time. If we do not do anything about
it, we will drift towards a dark future.
ReMY is our concept to avert such a future. A Supervision, Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) is interconnected with drones and buoys all over
the ocean. The system is based on CERN
technologies and able to track and monitor life below water. ReMY enables us to
save endangered species, boost science
and research and push fishing industry
towards sustainable methods.
This concept is based on the UN Development Goal 14 “Life below water”, which
aims to protect marine life and face societal needs in this context. We meet those UN
Sustainable Development Goals with the
support of CERN technology.
