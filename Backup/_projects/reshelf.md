### ReShelf

Minimizing human impact on the environment to achieve a sustainable future for society, is
one of the defining challenges of our time. While human-made climate change is
currently in the spotlight, other environmental issues such as sustainable
waste management remain unsolved as well. Especially electronic waste is a
growing problem with a yearly 45 million tons of e-waste and a recycling rate
of only 20%.

How can we extend product life cycles and reduce waste without additional cost or
inconvenience for the consumer?

Reshelf allows everybody to easily trade used items with each other. Reshelf is a
smart-shelf and an easy to use smartphone app. The app allows users to put used
items into the shelf and trade them for items others have put in. This extends
the products lifecycle leading to waste reduction and provides easy and cheap
access to used items. For example: When buying a new phone, it will include a
charger. Instead of letting your old charger collect dust in a drawer you can
make it useful with Reshelf! Of course, this also applies to the old phone
itself if it still works.
