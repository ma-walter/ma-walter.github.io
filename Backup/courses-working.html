                <h3>DTP</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Design Thinking Project (DTP), master students work on questions from <b>business and society</b> using the methods of <b>design thinking</b>. The students work in <b>international teams</b> with 6-9 elements and are accompanied by
                    experienced coaches. The teams consist of students from different fields of discipline of the HS Mannheim and members from another international university, which makes English the common language. Through <b>close collaboration</b> with the
                    corporate partner and the <b>high practical relevance of the challenges</b>, the teams learn how to develop innovative products and service concepts in a team. In this way, they are prepared for the innovation tasks of tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course is aimed to <b>master students from all faculties</b> of the university and lasts <b>two semesters</b>. At the end of the course, the students present their concept in the form of <b>executable prototype</b> in a presentation and
                    exhibition. The project is <b>based on the course taught at Stanford University</b> (ME310 course in Stanford, SUGAR Network), where this two-semester course has been taught for over 30 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mannheim University of Applied Sciences has already successfully completed several projects in the past three years. You can find more about them on our past projects page.
                </p>

                <h4>PROCEDURE</h4>
                <p>
                    The course starts at the end of September and ends in mid-June. There are fixed times when you meet as a team with the supervising professors and coaches. Workshops are held here and intermediate results are discussed. In addition, you will
                    arrange common times for the project work in the team according to your individual availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project requires a <b>strong commitment</b> and promises an intensive learning experience. Especially in the last quarter you spend a lot of time with the project. Within the framework of cooperation with the client and a partner
                    university, various trips lasting several days are connected.

                <p>
                    The Challenged Based Innovation (CBI) A3 program brings <b>CERN technologies</b> and the <b>UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</b> together. For the course of 7 months, students will design applications relevant to <b>future scenarios</b>
                    for 2020-2030.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CERN, being the European Organization for Nuclear Research, develops a numerous amount of complex technologies on their conquest of finding out the answer for fundamental questions of humankind â€“ Where do we come from? Where are we going?
                    What is the universe made of? - however, these technologies are being used solely on their advanced machinery and research. CBI aims to <b>combine real life problems with these technologies</b> and give them a societal application. Closing
                    the bridge between super science and society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, students will work within a multidisciplinary local team while having an international "buddy team". This means that teams can help each other and share knowledge, but they work independently. During the course, teams will
                    get to <b>explore the problems from their local context, CERN technology and spend 2 weeks at CERN</b> in Switzerland to get more insights from researchers and meet all the other teams that are spread globally. After researching, the team
                    has until January to to come to a common vision and a path they want to follow. After that, students will be provided with materials and activities to help them better understand the problem, CERN technologies and create predictions for the
                    scenarios of 2020, 2025 and 2030. The project is finalized in the end of April with a proof of concept prototype and a presentation.

                <p>
                    The project course <b>Global Digital Innovation Program (GDIP)</b> lets student solve <b>real-world challenges</b> in the area of <b>digital innovation</b> using <b>Design Thinking</b>. They develop solutions in the form of physical and digital prototypes that show the desirability, viability, and feasibility of their concept. The overall goal is to acquire the skills necessary to deal with an ever-changing and complex work environment with an international, interdisciplinary setup. The challenges are provided by a <b>company</b> and arise from the current pressure in the area of <b>digital transformation</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course is organized as an <b>action-based project</b> with <b>international teams</b>: three students from HS Mannheim team up <b>with three students of a partner university</b> from the Design Factory Global Network (DFGN). Together, they work on one <b>company challenge</b> with a teaching team coaching the whole process. In several <b>sprints</b> the students work on assignments leading them through the problem solving process and different facets of innovation. Several methods like user research, problem reframing, prototyping, user testing, etc. are introduced. At the end of the semester the student team presents one solution to the problem as <b>proof-of-concept demonstrator</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course is open for <b>bachelor students of all courses </b> in the 6th or 7th semester with a strong interest in working in an international setting. <b>Moderate English skills</b> are required to handle the communication with the international partner. The students get the chance to learn state-of-the-art methods in Design Thinking and problem solving and they gain international experience. The course replaces one elective (Wahlpflichtfach) with 5 credits (ECTS).
