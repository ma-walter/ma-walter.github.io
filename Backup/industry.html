          <p>Our offer is a <b>human-centric innovation program</b> to develop new products and services. The projects' problems can come from medium-sized and large companies and from a wide range of sectors (healthcare, telecommunications, software, transport, public institutions, etc.). At the beginning of the project, as a customer you will <b>formulate the problem</b> in the form of a "design brief", which we are happy to help constructing. The question presented in this briefing is so <b>open and broad</b> that the students will not develop only one solution, they will make <b>multiple iterations</b> and develop <b>various concepts and prototypes</b> througout the project, changing and deepening their understanding of the problem. The teams are made up of students from different faculties and we try to form them according to the technical requirements of the challenge. At the end they present an <b>executable demonstrator</b> whose quality has been <b>tested with regard to technological feasibility, user satisfaction and economic viability.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As a company you will get a <b>functional prototype</b> of an innovative product or service, <b>comprehensive documentation</b> of the complete journey, protoypes and findings, identification of <b>business opportunities</b>, insights into a systematic path to innovation (methods, culture, mindset) through observation of the student team, a combination of German engineering culture with the spirit of the Silicon Valley and being integrated into a <b>global innovation network</b>.
